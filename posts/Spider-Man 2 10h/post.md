# Spider-Man 2, 10 Hours In

### Note: This post does <u>**NOT**</u> contain spoilers

So far, I'm 10 hours into the new Spider-Man game. The quick and short of it is. If you have a PS5 you need to play this. If you're on the fence of getting a PS5, this might just push you over.

The game really take advantage of the PS5. Not just in terms of the (very good) graphics. But in terms of loading, or the lack of. From seamless fast travel, to fights that take place across the city.

I could go on about the game. But I don't want to spoil the fantastic story. I you have a PS5, and you like Marvel / Spider-Man. Play it.
