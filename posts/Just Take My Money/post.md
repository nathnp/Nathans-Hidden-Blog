# Just Take My Money

Over the past couple days, I have have been trying to buy a game... trying.

This is the first time I've gone to buy a game off of Humble Bundle. They have PC building sim with like eight DLCs for $10. Sick, I'll pick that up... They don't want my money. He's a breakdown of what I've tried.

Debit card (Apple Pay) <br>
Gold card (Apple Pay) <br>
Debit card (card number) <br>
Gold card (card number) <br>
Privacy card <br>
Debit card (PayPal) <br>

With all of these methods, the payment was either instantly denied(more on that), or sent to review, and denied.

This interesting thing is, the purchase was always denied by Humble Bundle. My credit union didn't deny it. Nor did Privacy or American Express. 

Just take my money guys
