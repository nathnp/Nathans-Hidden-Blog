# New Router

And as it descended down from the heavens, one word was uttered... Egg.

Yeah, it looks more like a Tic-Tac, but I'm sticking with egg.

The new router has been up and running for a few days now. Damn is it nice. <br>
I love the deep setting, I can customize my network in ways the ASUS couldn't. I won't go into what you can do with the UDR (YouTube has the covered). I'm just happy to have a network again.
