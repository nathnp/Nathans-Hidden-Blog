# SteamOS 3.5 Beta

The SteamOS 3.5 beta has dropped. And man is it a nice little upgrade.

It doesn't bring any massive features to the table, just quality of life changes. Such as: fixing the SMT bug, adding HDR support, speeding up wake from sleep, and more.

Fixing the SMT bug helps with emulation performance (looking at you PS3 and Switch). Mario Odyssey runs a lot better in the Metro Kingdom (the big city).

HDR support is here. If you have an external monitor that supports it.

The faster wake from sleep though, that's really doing it for me. From what I've seen online, it's about a second faster, but it feels way faster. 

Overall, I'm pretty happy with this beta. With that said, if you want to install this on your deck. Keep in mind that is is a beta. Your mileage may very.
