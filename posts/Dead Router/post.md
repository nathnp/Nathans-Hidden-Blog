# Router Died

It’s all quiet here. Laptops closed, servers powered off, just, quiet. Not because a break was needed from the internet. But because I can’t get to the internet. It’s more than that. I don’t have a working local network either. 

The router didn’t completely die. Its built in AP still works, and so does its config web server. What doesn’t work however, is the built in Ethernet ports. So it’s basically dead. Leaving with no network. Not wide, not even local. 

With its death, I’ve powered off my home servers. Why add hours to the drives, when they can’t serve anyone. 

This won’t last much longer though. Coming in the mail tomorrow is a brand new [UNiFi UDR](https://store.ui.com/us/en/products/udr). Should work better than the dead ASUS.
