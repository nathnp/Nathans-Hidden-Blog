# Closing Down The Hidden Blog

Hey everyone,

Over the past week. I have been working on moving my main site away from blot. You can read about the here [here](https://nthp.me/posts/new-new-site/). I was fulling planning on moving the hidden blog over to the same solution as the main site. However, doing so would break one of my main goals for this site. Not having a public non RSS list of posts. 

Until I can come up with a solution for that, I will be shutting down the hidden blog. All the posts have been backed up, and are now publicly available. You can view the on this [Github repo](https://github.com/nathnp/Nathans-Hidden-Blog).
