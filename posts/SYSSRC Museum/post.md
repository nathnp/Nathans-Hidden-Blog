# SYSSRC Museum

Just got back from the System Source Museum here in Maryland. I'm currently pulling the photos off of my phone to upload to Flickr. That's going to take a bit, as I shot over 100, and I shot all of them in 48Mpx Pro Raw... It's going to take a while. So here's a few lower res pics as a preview.

Keep an eye on my Mastodon [@nthp@fosstodon.org](https://fosstodon.org/@nthp) for the Flickr album when it's done.
