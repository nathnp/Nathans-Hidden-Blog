# Welcome

Welcome to my hidden blog. If you’re reading this, then this site is working!!

I’m hosting this site using [blot.im](https://blot.im), just like my [main site](https://nthp.me). I’m using the same template as well, I just had to rip a fair bit out to get what I wanted. Here’s a quick break down of what I wanted. 

1. No post listings on the site. 
 
2. Posts to show up over RSS
 
3. The ability to view posts on the site, if you have the link

Number two was easy, blot already creates a feed out the door for you. 

Number one took some more work. But not that much. I just deleted the entries.html and archive.html files. Boom. 

Number three took some work. I wanted it so that a reader could share a post. Not hard, that still worked. But, they would see (with previews) links to the next and last posts. I didn’t want that, as it would ruin the fun. It took some work, but I ripped all that stuff out of the entry.html file. 

And that’s it. I now have a blog that can only be read over RSS. Neat. 

I’ll toss the modified template on my [GitHub](https://github.com/nathnp) later
