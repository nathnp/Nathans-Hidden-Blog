# You Will Loose This Game (Probably)

Can you win a game of Rock Paper Scissors against a video? The odds are not in your favor (if you play honestly). [CGP Grey](https://www.youtube.com/@CGPGrey) has released a test of your luck. Can you beat the odds, and be, 1 in a million?

This was a ton of fun to play. I won't give any hints, or the answers, just play it. Though I will say, if you loose on the first round. Don't just click off the video, click the Fail card. You won't regret it.
