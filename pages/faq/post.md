# FAQ

### What is a hidden blog?

A hidden blog is a blog that can only be read via its RSS feed. 

### How can I read posts?

Simply subscribe to the RSS feed. 

### How do I subscribe to the RSS feed?

You’ll need an RSS reader. [Here’s a list of a few](https://bloggingwizard.com/free-rss-feed-readers/). I personally use [Reeder 5](https://www.reederapp.com) for iOS and Mac.

### Can I share posts?

Yep, posts can be viewed on the site, if you have the link(you’ll get that from your RSS reader). All you have to do, is share that link. 

### Why can't I view older posts?

You might need to change how long your reader retains articles before deletion.
